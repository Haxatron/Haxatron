## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Haxatron

I am previously a Web2 security researcher turned Web3 security researcher having earned $750K+ rewards across different audit platforms. 

I specialize in blockchain infrastructure and complex systems, spanning across a wide variety of topics: cross-chain bridging, layer 1 and layer 2, execution and consensus layers, Cosmos SDK. Below is a sample of my past work:
