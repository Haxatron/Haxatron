### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a open-source security researcher finding and reporting security vulnerabilities affecting various open-source projects

If you would like me to take a look at you repository (for free), you can contact me at haxatron1@gmail.com with the name of your repository. Security issues will be reported via [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/policy/)

Factors I take into account when deciding whether to review:

- Ease of Installation (Dockerfiles are great!)
- Number of stars / forks (should be 2000+)

### My CVEs

Note: I use huntr.dev as a CNA (Certificate Numbering Authority), so CVE numbers are allocated close to one another.

CVE Count: 22

| CVE-2021-3906 | Uploaded Files with broken extensions will be served as Content-Type: text/html leading to XSS / Phishing vector |  [bookstack](https://www.github.com/bookstackapp/bookstack) | https://huntr.dev/bounties/f115bdf5-c06b-4627-a6fa-ba6904a43ba3/ | This one required a bit of experimentation - and of course, source-code review |
| CVE-2021-4119 | Improper Access Control + SQL Wildcard injection leads to dumping of user details |  [bookstack](https://www.github.com/bookstackapp/bookstack) | https://huntr.dev/bounties/135f2d7d-ab0b-4351-99b9-889efac46fca/ | I've never heard of SQL wildcard injection before writing this report. This one required source-code review |
| CVE-2021-4026 | (Improper Access Control) Attachments of draft pages can be accessed via API |  [bookstack](https://www.github.com/bookstackapp/bookstack) | https://huntr.dev/bounties/c6dfa80d-43e6-4b49-95af-cc031bb66b1d/ | Always check the APIs available! |

However, cloning and duplication forms definitely need at least "view" access control checks to prevent leak of data. |
| CVE-2021-4075 | POST-based SSRF in Slack Webhooks as admin | [snipe-it](https://www.github.com/snipe/snipe-it) | https://huntr.dev/bounties/4386fd8b-8c80-42bb-87b8-b506c46597de/ | - |
